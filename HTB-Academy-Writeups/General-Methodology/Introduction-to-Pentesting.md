# HTB Academy: Introduction to Pentesting - Module Recap

## 🎯 Objective
This module establishes the foundational framework for conducting professional penetration tests. It moves beyond simple "hacking" and focuses on a structured, legal, and ethical methodology used in the industry.

## 🏛️ The Pentesting Lifecycle
I have mastered the 4 main stages of a professional engagement:

### 1. Pre-Engagement
* **Concepts:** Defining the Scope, Rules of Engagement (RoE), and Service Level Agreements (SLA).
* **Importance:** Ensuring all activities are legal and that the client's infrastructure is protected.

### 2. Information Gathering & Reconnaissance
* **Passive Recon:** Gathering data without direct interaction (OSINT, WHOIS, DNS records).
* **Active Recon:** Direct interaction with targets to identify live hosts and services.
* **Key Tools:** `Nmap`, `NSLookup`, `Dig`, and `Ffuf`.

### 3. Vulnerability Analysis
* **Goal:** Identifying weaknesses in the discovered services.
* **Research:** Using databases like **Exploit-DB**, **NIST NVD**, and **CVE Mitre** to find known exploits (applied today in the *MangoBleed* Sherlock).

### 4. Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
* **Execution:** Gaining initial access while maintaining system stability.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Moving from a low-privileged user to a high-privileged user (Root/System).
* **Persistence:** Understanding how attackers maintain access (e.g., creating local accounts, as seen in the *Brutus* Sherlock).

## 🛡️ Ethics and Reporting
A pentest is only as good as its final report. I learned:
* The importance of documenting every step for the client.
* How to categorize risks using **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).
* The critical difference between "Ethical Hacking" and malicious activity.

## 🏁 Conclusion
Completing this module has provided me with the "Roadmap" for my future labs. I can now approach any Hack The Box machine with a clear strategy rather than random guessing.
