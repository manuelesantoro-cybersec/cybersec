## 🧠 Comprehensive Study Cheat Sheet (Exam Prep)

This section serves as a quick reference for key terminology and methodologies required for the CJCA exam and professional interviews.

### 1. The Pentesting Lifecycle (PTES Standard)
| Phase | Goal | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Engagement** | Define rules | Scoping, RoE (Rules of Engagement), NDA signing. |
| **Information Gathering** | Map the target | Passive OSINT, Active Scanning (Nmap), Enumeration. |
| **Vulnerability Assessment**| Find weaknesses | Analyzing services for known CVEs or misconfigurations. |
| **Exploitation** | Gain access | Bypassing security controls to get an initial shell. |
| **Post-Exploitation** | Expand control | Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Persistence. |
| **Reporting** | Communicate risk | Writing Technical & Executive summaries with CVSS scores. |

### 2. Testing Methodologies (The "Boxes")
* **Black Box:** Zero knowledge. Simulates a standard external attacker.
* **Grey Box:** Partial knowledge (e.g., user credentials). Most common in professional tests.
* **White Box:** Full access to source code and network diagrams. Focuses on deep security audits.

### 3. Industry Frameworks & Standards
* **OWASP:** The gold standard for **Web Application** security.
* **NIST SP 800-115:** A comprehensive guide to technical security testing.
* **OSSTMM:** Focused on operational security and scientific metrics.
* **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** A numerical score (0-10) representing the severity of a vulnerability.

### 4. Legal & Ethical Keywords
* **Scope:** The boundaries of the test (what IP/domain is allowed).
* **Compliance:** Testing to meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
* **Ethics:** The commitment to do no harm, maintain confidentiality, and act legally.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology Integration
While progressing through **Pentest in a Nutshell**, I am correlating these offensive phases with my defensive studies:
* **Active Recon** ➡️ Correlates with **Network Traffic Analysis** (Wireshark).
* **Exploitation** ➡️ Correlates with **Log Monitoring** (Windows Event Logs).
* **Privilege Escalation** ➡️ Correlates with **Threat Hunting** (Finding "Evil" processes).

*Target Exam Date: Mid-March 2026*
